# guess-the-number
Both codes implement number guessing games, but they take different approaches.

Code 1 (Computer Guesses):

In this code, the computer tries to guess the number chosen by the user.
The user provides feedback to the computer's guesses (too high, too low, correct).
The computer adjusts its guesses based on the user's feedback to eventually guess the correct number.

Code 2 (User Guesses):

In this code, the user tries to guess the randomly chosen number by the computer.
The user inputs their guesses, and the program provides feedback (too high, too low) until the correct number is guessed.
